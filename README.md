R scripts and code for the manuscript: 'Nature-Inspired Design Principles Promote Supply Network Resilience'

Nature-Inspired-Supply-Networks
R code to simulate supply networks. This code is associated with a submitted manuscript and may therefore undergo changes based on reviewer comments. In addition, the manuscript deals with only a portion of the code capability. Most notably, the code includes functionality to allow certain nodes to join together in temporary coalitions. Future planned manuscripts will address these capabilities.
